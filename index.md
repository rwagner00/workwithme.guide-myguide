## Values

* Open Mindedness -- New solutions are found all the time even problems long considered solved.  Novel approaches and ideas deserve to be heard out and considered on their own merits and without bias.
* Honesty -- Anecdotally, there's almost no problem which can be encountered during good faith interactions which can't be resolved through an honest discussion. Even when well meaning, less than fully truthful words have a tendency to cause problems down the road.
* Tact -- Being honest (see what I did there?), I learned the merits of honesty long before I learned the merits of tact. Just because (for example), a bit of code is poorly thought through and will cause problems is not an excuse to say so in a way that will shatter hopes and dreams. This is something I still struggle with sometimes, but am constantly working on. If you  see a time where I probably should have used more tact than I did, by all means say so. 
* Willingness to learn -- Until The Matrix delivers us the ability to learn through having the information inserted manually, we all have at least one more thing we need to learn before we know everything. Willingness to learn makes one a more valuable team member, individual contributor, and often simply a better friend/ally to those around you.  

## Personality

Unless I'm excited about something, I'm fairly relaxed and easygoing. I do my absolute best to be a methodical and conscientious person, and will always choose to laugh rather than cry if at all possible. My very favorite question is "Why?", and the quickest way to throw wrenches into my mental gears is to answer "Because.". Context is important, and whenever I'm lost (figuratively or literally), it's the first thing I look for.

## Receiving Feedback & Recognition

Open Mindedness is something I bring to reception of feedback. As long as the feedback is constructive and intended to help ("When you do X, it causes Y, so doing Z would be preferable." vs. "You suck at X."), I'm very open to critique. I can't do better if I don't know I'm doing it wrong now, after all. 

Praise is always welcome, and when it's offered I'm not choosy over the venue or deliver. I'm just glad that something I did was helpful and appreciated! I find positive feedback energizing and a good sign that I'm on the right track and should continue doing that thing. Going long periods of time without feedback (positive or negative) tends to drag me down, since it seems like the work I'm doing isn't relevant or meaningful.

## Work Patterns

I work from 9AM->6PM with an hour break for lunch sometime around 12:30, though I strongly prefer not to have meetings before 10AM. Given my own preference about the universe, owls and I would run the same schedule. 

## Communication Preferences

By far the best way to get in touch with me is to @me on Slack. Email noise is just too high to constantly check notifications and derail from the work being done. Slack @'s though, I will always notice unless I'm *truly* deep in the weeds.

## How To Know Iâ€™ve Gone To The Dark Side

### Warning Signs

I'm pretty easy going, and it takes a lot to get under my skin. That in mind, the overwhelming majority of the time if it's something I can't deal with on my own I'll just ping my manager and say outright that I need help with whatever is going on. My value of honesty means that if I don't tell someone that something is wrong, it isn't fair for me to expect them to know. 

## Me Being Me

Brevity, especially when written, is not meant negatively! It isn't my nature to use 100 words to explain a problem if 10 will do. I'm told (and I try very hard to be aware of this) that sometimes my succinctness can be interpreted as annoyance, which is very rarely the case. It's almost never an issue in spoken conversation these days, but sometimes it can be when I'm writing. That's why I use more emoji's than the average bear.

## Areas for Development

* Making sure my "tone" in written text comes across correctly
* Resisting the urge to dive into the weeds on tickets
* New programming languages!

## Ask Me About

* Harry Potter
* Video games
* Tweaks, enhancements, and apps to make the workday just that little bit more productive and smooth. 
* Or just the weather in Georgia! I'm always up for making new friends!
